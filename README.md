# AutoLayout-Dicee

This is the same app with Dicee. In other words, the functionality and behaviour of both of them are same. However, in addition to what dicee app has, AutoLayout Dicee app has auto layout feature. Thus, it does not only look good on the canvas dimension which we have selected, but it looks good on different aspect ratio screen. Hence, it cannot be broken anymore, when we turn it to landscape mod. To be more precise, in this app, I add constraints and applied Auto Layout. I also pinned and aligned elements and created containers and Stack Views. After added Stack View, I divided the screen into three parts and called them as Top View, Middle View, and Bottom View. I added the dicee logo, dice images and button respectively. After added them, I also use constraints locally. Additionally, I prefer to use Scale to Fit as a Content Mode for Stack View and each part of it. Finally, I created constraints which contain everything in the app.
